# Education and Cognitive Performance Across Alzheimer’s Groups

This project explores how education level relates to cognitive performance in older adults, and whether this relationship differs between individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitively normal controls. The analysis uses publicly available data from the OASIS study and focuses on exploratory patterns in cognitive test scores across education levels and clinical groups.

## Dataset

Data are drawn from the OASIS longitudinal demographics dataset provided by the Washington University School of Medicine. To ensure independent observations, only baseline visits are included so that each participant appears once.

## Variables

- **MMSE** – Mini-Mental State Examination score (cognitive performance)
- **EDUC** – Years of formal education completed
- **Group** – Alzheimer’s disease vs. cognitively normal

## Research Question

How is education level associated with cognitive performance, and does this association differ across Alzheimer’s groups?

## Methods Overview

The project uses exploratory data analysis and basic statistical modeling, with visualizations designed for interpretation in an introductory statistics context.

## Intended Use

This project was completed for an academic statistics course and is intended for educational and exploratory purposes only.
