# Education and Cognitive Performance Across Alzheimer’s Groups

This project explores how years of education relate to cognitive performance in older adults, and how the cognitive scores differ between individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitively normal controls. The analysis uses publicly available data from the OASIS study and focuses on exploratory patterns in cognitive test scores (MMSE) across education levels and clinical groups.

## Dataset

Data are drawn from the OASIS longitudinal demographics dataset provided by the Washington University School of Medicine. To ensure independent observations, only baseline visits (Visit = 0) are included so that each participant appears once. Individuals grouped as "Converted" are excluded to maintain clearly defined groups.

## Variables

- **MMSE** – Mini-Mental State Examination score (cognitive performance)
- **EDUC** – Years of formal education completed
- **Group** – Alzheimer’s disease vs. cognitively normal

## Research Questions

- Are MMSE scores associated with years of education among older adults with and without Alzheimer’s disease?
- Do MMSE scores differ between individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and cognitively normal individuals?


## Methods Overview

The project uses exploratory data analysis and basic statistical modeling (using R Studio), with visualizations designed for interpretation in an introductory statistics context.

## Intended Use

This project is being completed for an academic statistics course and is intended for educational and exploratory purposes only.
